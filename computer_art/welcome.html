        <td width="100%">The <strong><font color="#4A7B99">Blueroom</font></strong> (1997) is
        inspired by my friend's&nbsp; bedroom. Essentially, he lived in a barren boxroom that
        still had a sense of serenity.&nbsp; He is a nomad with no belongings and somehow he seems
        at home with just a bed and window. <p>The <font color="#615F4E"><strong>Boxroom</strong></font>
        (1997) is a reinterpretation of the <font color="#4A7B99">Blueroom</font>.&nbsp; It was a
        search for serenity within a perfect cube.&nbsp; Most of the objects are taken from my
        belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I worked on this room, it became a collection of different
        things in my life, locked in a box.&nbsp; </td>
