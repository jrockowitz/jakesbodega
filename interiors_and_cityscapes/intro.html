        is a landmark Victorian style house which can be described as a blue Mary Poppins house.
        There is something wonderful about the area and space, inside and outside the house. The
        Cupola studies are about the panoramic view from the top of the house.&nbsp; These studies
        led to the creation of the <a href="../cupola/index.html">Cupola </a>Sculpture. The
        Basement series is about the space I grew up in. I find everyday scenes around the house
        interesting and desire to capture them.</font></td>
